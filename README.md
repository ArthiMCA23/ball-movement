# ball-movement


## Description:

This web application show cases a basic animation of a rolling ball that maves back and forth diagonally across the webpage.
 the ball changes its direction when it reaches the boundaries of the browser window, creating an entertaining visual
 effect.


## How to run the code:

Step 1: Save the HTML file with a .html extension.

Step 2: Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code, then click the "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VSCode window to open a new browser window displaying the ball-moving animation.


## Future improvement:

consider adding user interaction features like mouse or keyboard control to change the ball's direction or speed, or adding obstacles or targets for the ball to interact with, creating a more engaging and interactive animation.
